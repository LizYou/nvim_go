# NeoVim Configuration for Linux Kernel Development

This is a lua based, bootstrap-able NeoVim Configuration for C development (for example, Linux Kernel or Qemu).

## Prerequisite

1. Install NeoVim. Refer to [NeoVim Installation Wiki](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
2. Have access to github.com. Proxy may need to be configured if sitting in internal network.

## Install

1. Do following to cleanup previous nvim related configurations
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
```
2. Clone this repo to ~/.config/nvim
3. Launch 'nvim'. This will download all the necessary plugins automatically.
4. Quit nvim, and relaunch nvim. That's it.

## Post-Install

1. Install language servers (clangd, bashls, etc.). Refer to [server_configurations.md](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) on how to install language servers.
2. Install Nerd fonts

## Generate compile_commands.json

If it is C repo, the file compile_commands.json is needed for language server clangd to work.

### Linux Kernel

Run scripts/clang-tools/gen_compile_commands.py after kernel compiling. This will generate compile_commands.json in the top directory.
Using nvim to edit a file in the repo will make clangd start to act as a language server.

### Qemu

Qemu automatically generate a compile_commands.json in its build/ directory, so no extra actions is needed for Qemu.
